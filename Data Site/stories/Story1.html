<h2><span lang=EN-GB>UK Cycling Incidents Occur 80 Percent of The Time in Urban
Areas</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In 2016, cyclists were involved in 18,936
road incidents, 80 percent of which occurred in urban areas, according to
government data. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This national pattern is mirrored in individual
police forces as well. The Metropolitan police jurisdiction, comprised
primarily of urban areas, contributed to 24 percent of UK incidents. Even areas
with minor urban areas demonstrate the same issue. Of the 248 incidents in the
South Wales area, 110 occurred in Cardiff. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Many of these accidents are a result of
vehicle drivers failing to maintain an adequate distance from cyclists. </span><span
lang=EN-GB>Urban areas tend to produce heavier traffic which only amplifies
this issue. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In an effort to reduce these incidents,
West Midlands police introduced Operation Close Pass. The objective is to
enforce an appropriate distance between vehicles and bicycles. It is executed
by out-of-uniform policemen on bicycles who educate offending vehicle drivers.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>PC Mark Hodson from West Midlands Police’s
Force Traffic Unit says, </span><span lang=EN-GB>“we’ve seen reports of
close-passes halve in the West Midlands since we started the project”. Hodson
also cites a noticeable behavioural change in vehicle drivers. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The positive change in the West Midlands
has incited Cycling UK to campaign for all UK police forces to implement
Operation Close Pass. The organisation’s senior road safety officer </span><span
lang=EN-GB>Duncan Dollimore says </span><span lang=EN-GB>“It’s a cost effective
initiative that has proved highly effective at changing dangerous driving
behaviour”. </span></p>

<div style='border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none;padding:0in'><span lang=EN-GB>Police
forces are currently debating whether to institute the initiative. Data shows
that those responsible for urban areas have a greater responsibility to ensure
all vehicle drivers are aware of the issue. Within South Wales, this area is
Cardiff and Cardiff North AM Julie Morgan says </span><span lang=EN-GB>“anything
that can make cycling safer and more attractive is a good thing”. However, </span><span
lang=EN-GB>South Wales police has already rejected the initiative in favour of
existing methods. </span></p>
