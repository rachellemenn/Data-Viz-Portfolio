<p class=MsoNormal>The Gender Pay Gap Increases to 18.2 Percent in 2017</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to ONS data, men earned 18.2 percent more than
women in the United Kingdom during 2017. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since 2011, the pay gap for all employees has decreased by
1.8 percent, but increased by 0.2 percent in the last year. Data for full-time
employees indicate even less of a change, with only a 1.4 percent decrease in
the last six years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=602 height=452 id="Picture 1"
src="Story2_files/image001.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The above graph demonstrates the mean hourly pay for full-time
employees of both genders. The red line indicates the percentage pay gap over
the six-year period. The graph visualises how minimal the change has been since
2011.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ONS determines the gender pay gap by finding the
difference between men’s and women’s median salary. The data considers a
variety of other factors, including location, age and occupation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Occupation has one of the strongest impacts on the pay gap. The
pay gap is consistently in favour of men, but varies depending on the
profession. Jobs stereotypically associated with women, such as administration,
demonstrate a lower pay gap at about 6.2 percent. However, salaries of health
professionals have a 17 percent gap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This data considers the median pay of the middle 80 percent
of earners – excluding most outliers – but it does not consider several
factors, such as the impact of domestic responsibilities on skill-building and
hours, gender segregation, the proportion of women to men in specific occupations,
and quality of work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not all equality variables are empiric. Though longevity
does not solely equate experience, tenure still provides an idea as to how
women’s experience is valued in comparison to men’s experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=601 height=731 id="Picture 7"
src="Story2_files/image002.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The graph above demonstrates that female salary grows with
tenure, but the gap does not decrease. Additionally, experience generates a
higher and longer salary growth for men than it does for women.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sam Smethers, the chief executive of Fawcett Society notes
that women enter the workforce with an existing pay gap which “has grown since
last year suggesting that we are going backwards not forwards. As women
progress in their working lives their value relative to their male colleagues
declines”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The government first addressed the gender pay gap 38 years
ago with the passing of the 1970 Equal Pay Act, superseded by the 2010 Equal
Pay Act. Though the gap has since decreased, it remains overwhelmingly in
favour of men. More recently, the government has required all companies with at
least 250 employees to publish figures related to the gender pay gap by April
2018. Only a fraction of the companies have done so, despite only four months
remaining until the deadline. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The October New York Times report about Harvey Weinstein
inspired a social movement driven by women vocalising their experiences with
workplace harassment and, by extension, all workplace inequality. Recently, the
topic has frequented the news cycle with some high-profile women quitting their
jobs including E! New anchor Catt Sadler and BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chloe Varty, a financial analyst at Johnson &amp; Johnson says
“In the last few months, I’ve seen a shift in the workplace environment. Female
co-workers have become more assertive, asking questions in attempt to find
transparency regarding salary equality”.  While fair comparisons will indicate
that legal efforts to enforce equality in a workplace are making a difference, it
is evident that social inequality and gender expectations are leading factors
of the gender pay gap. The issue may need to be addressed at a younger age to
change and equalise career expectations of both genders. Perhaps the current
social climate will incite a more significant change than there has been in the
last six years.</p>
