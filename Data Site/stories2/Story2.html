<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Gender Pay Gap Increases to 18.2
Percent in 2017</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>According to ONS data, men earned 18.2
percent more than women in the United Kingdom during 2017. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Since 2011, the pay gap for all employees
has decreased by 1.8 percent, but increased by 0.2 percent in the last year.
Data for full-time employees indicate even less of a change, with only a 1.4
percent decrease in the last six years. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The above graph demonstrates the mean
hourly pay for full-time employees of both genders. The red line indicates the
percentage pay gap over the six-year period. The graph visualises how minimal
the change has been since 2011.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The ONS determines the gender pay gap by
finding the difference between men’s and women’s median salary. The data
considers a variety of other factors, including location, age and occupation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Occupation has one of the strongest impacts
on the pay gap. The pay gap is consistently in favour of men, but varies
depending on the profession. Jobs stereotypically associated with women, such
as administration, demonstrate a lower pay gap at about 6.2 percent. However, salaries
of health professionals have a 17 percent gap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This data considers the median pay of the
middle 80 percent of earners – excluding most outliers – but it does not
consider several factors, such as the impact of domestic responsibilities on
skill-building and hours, gender segregation, the proportion of women to men in
specific occupations, and quality of work. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Not all equality variables are empiric. Though
longevity does not solely equate experience, tenure still provides an idea as
to how women’s experience is valued in comparison to men’s experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><img width=601 height=731 id="Picture 7"

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The graph above demonstrates that female
salary grows with tenure, but the gap does not decrease. Additionally,
experience generates a higher and longer salary growth for men than it does for
women.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sam Smethers, the chief executive of
Fawcett Society notes that women enter the workforce with an existing pay gap
which “has grown since last year suggesting that we are going backwards not
forwards. As women progress in their working lives their value relative to
their male colleagues declines”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The government first addressed the gender
pay gap 38 years ago with the passing of the 1970 Equal Pay Act, superseded by
the 2010 Equal Pay Act. Though the gap has since decreased, it remains
overwhelmingly in favour of men. More recently, the government has required all
companies with at least 250 employees to publish figures related to the gender
pay gap by April 2018. Only a fraction of the companies have done so, despite only
four months remaining until the deadline. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The October New York Times report about
Harvey Weinstein inspired a social movement driven by women vocalising their
experiences with workplace harassment and, by extension, all workplace
inequality. Recently, the topic has frequented the news cycle with some
high-profile women quitting their jobs including E! New anchor Catt Sadler and
BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Chloe Varty, a financial analyst at Johnson
&amp; Johnson says “In the last few months, I’ve seen a shift in the workplace
environment. Female co-workers have become more assertive, asking questions in
attempt to find transparency regarding salary equality”.  While fair
comparisons will indicate that legal efforts to enforce equality in a workplace
are making a difference, it is evident that social inequality and gender
expectations are leading factors of the gender pay gap. The issue may need to
be addressed at a younger age to change and equalise career expectations of
both genders. Perhaps the current social climate will incite a more significant
change than there has been in the last six years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Methodology</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Graph 1</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The line + bar graph format was chosen to
demonstrate two different relationships. The bar graph (referenced by the
left-hand side) compares male and female salaries. The line graph (referenced
by the right-hand side) demonstrates the percentage pay gap based on the
differences in salaries. It visualises the gender pay gap, laying the
foundation for the article.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Graph 2</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A paired column format was chosen to
compare the impact of tenure on salary for both genders. There is enough
significance between men’s and women’s data that a column graph adequately demonstrates
the differences. This graph visualises how experiences are not valued equally
for both genders.</span></p>
